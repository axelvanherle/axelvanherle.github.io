Currently pursuing a Master's degree in Industrial Engineering with a focus on Electronics-ICT at Hasselt University, with an expected graduation in June 2027.

I completed my Professional Bachelor's degree in Electronics-ICT at Hogeschool PXL (September 2021 - June 2024), where I graduated cum laude. During my time at PXL, I also pursued a creditcontract for a Professional Bachelor's degree in Business Management (February 2024 - June 2024), achieving summa cum laude honors.

Prior to this, I graduated with a High School Diploma in Media and Web Design from Atlas College Kunst & Vormgeving in June 2021. Before that, I also earned a High School Diploma in Latin / Humanities and Social Sciences from Don Bosco Hechtel in September 2017.
