Welcome to my blog! First, I want to make it clear that my intention is not to boast or instruct anyone. Rather, I am here to share my passion for writing and to document my experiences for future reflection. Of course, if my content happens to be helpful or engaging for others, that’s an added bonus.

As a student of electronics ICT, or computer engineering as it’s more commonly referred to, I am always seeking to learn about the latest advancements in technology and how they can be applied to real-world challenges. In particular, I am drawn to the fields of Linux, automation, DevOps, and web design. Through this blog, I share my insights and experiences with anyone who is interested, whether you’re a fellow student, a tech enthusiast, or simply someone curious about these topics.

If you have any questions or would like to connect, feel free to reach out to me on any of the platforms listed below. And for those curious, i mainly program in C/C++.
