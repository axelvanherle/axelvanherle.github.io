title: "Programs i use"
---

You can probably find what i list here on my GitHub in my [dotfiles](https://github.com/axelvanherle/dotfiles) repo.

# Basic

### Operating system
- My favorite disto is Arch, this is also what i run on my server. On my laptop and desktop i run EndeavourOS simply because it's easier to install, and comes with certain things set up OOB, like an AUR helper. 

### Terminal
- I currently use Alacritty, it's minimal enough OOB for me, and offers a way to easily customize it to my liking.

### Shell
- I use zsh as my shell. It's posix compliant, and allows to me add plugins and shit like that. I used Luke Smith's [config](https://gist.github.com/LukeSmithxyz/e62f26e55ea8b0ed41a65912fbebbe52), with a few added features of my own. It uses vim binds, which is something unmissable in my shell once i started using it.

### WM/DE
- I currently use Xfce on my desktop, and Gnome on my laptop. I enjoy the simplicity of Xfce on my desktop, and the "bloated" things Gnome comes with are useful for a machine that needs to justwork on my day to day. I'm a heavy touchpad user, and Gnome allows me to customize these to my needs.

### Text editor
- Neovim

### Browser
- Firefox, of course.


# Utilities

### File manager
- I just use whatever my DE comes with. I don't interact with it much, as i primarily use lf. This is built into my shell, so makes it useful to navigate my system in my terminal.

### RSS reader
- Newsboat, set up with vim binds and with organized places where each topic goes.

### Image editor
- GIMP
