This page contains an archive of some of the projects I have completed over the years. While many of these projects have taught me valuable skills and insights, not all of them are showcased here. The purpose of this page is not to boast about my accomplishments but rather to serve as a platform for cataloging my work and preventing the loss of my projects. It is worth noting that this page is consistent with the purpose of the rest of my blog.

# This blog!
Found [here](https://github.com/axelvanherle/axelvanherle.github.io).

I used Hugo and GitHub Actions to set up this website, which provided me with valuable insights into the world of web design. You can find out how i did it [here](https://www.axelvanherle.xyz/post/20-02-22_howigotthisup/)

# P2P-TCP-chatclient-NP
Found [here](https://github.com/axelvanherle/P2P-TCP-chatclient-NP).

A peer-to-peer chat client in C++ using object-oriented programming principles and QT. The chat client allows users to connect with each other using TCP protocol, communicate through sending and receiving messages, and receive a list of connected peers. The chat client is designed to be extensible, with new peers being added dynamically, and with the ability to send and receive messages to and from all connected peers. I made a blog post explaining it, which you can find [here](https://www.axelvanherle.xyz/post/21-02-23_p2ptcpchatclient/).

# imgConvolutionCuda-C
Found [here](https://github.com/axelvanherle/imgConvolutionCuda-C).

As part of the Hardware Accelerated Computing course, I completed an assignment that involved reading a PNG image, converting it to grayscale, applying a kernel, and performing max and min pooling on the image using C. Following this, I repeated the process using CUDA, which significantly improved the performance of the program. Through this project, I gained a great deal of experience with CUDA and parallelizing applications.

# IoTProject_1
Found [here](https://github.com/axelvanherle/IoTProject_1).

In the IoT course, we were required to establish some infrastructure, and we chose to use OpenRemote with Docker containers. This experience taught me a great deal about Docker. Additionally, we developed several UDP clients in C using Berkeley sockets that transmit random values, and these programs can run within a cross-compiled Docker container. Through this project, I also gained valuable experience in setting up servers.

# ticTacToeInCPP_task1
Found [here](https://github.com/axelvanherle/ticTacToeInCPP_task1).

As part of the C++ course, we were required to develop a game, and I chose to create Tic Tac Toe. While the game itself is relatively straightforward, I focused heavily on the devops aspect. Specifically, I utilized GitHub actions to create cross-compiled Docker containers and push an executable with all the necessary DLLs, making it easy for Windows users to download and run the game.

# packetsInC 
Found [here](https://github.com/axelvanherle/packetsInC).

As part of this project, I created four distinct applications, namely the UDP Client, UDP Server, TCP Client, and TCP Server. These applications are capable of communicating with one another over the internet by utilizing Berkeley sockets in the C programming language. It was the biggest project i did yet, and taught me alot about C. I gave lessons to peers about this subject, i was this good in it.

# webTech
Found [here](https://github.com/axelvanherle/webTech).

For the webtech course, we were assigned to work with HTML, Markdown, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, Ajax, PHP and SQL. This project showcases my progress with each language. As you will see, I have only covered the basics of each language, which was the primary objective of the assignment. It also served as a way to learn more about correct usage of Git.

# 1EAI-PO-SD
Found [here](https://github.com/axelvanherle/1EAI-PO-SD).

This project is where i designed my first ever PCB! It involved designing both the PCB and its accompanying case.

# imgSmoothingCP2
Found [here](https://github.com/axelvanherle/imgSmoothingCP2).

This C program is designed to take an input BMP image and convert it into various output images without relying on any external libraries. The images undergo a range of transformations depending on what the user chooses, including smoothing, redscaling, bluescaling, greenscaling, and grayscale conversion. My second coding project ever, this time with a better partner.

# CP1-Bj
Found [here](https://github.com/axelvanherle/CP1-BJ).

This C program allows you to play blackjack against my program. It was my first ever coding assignment, and unfortunately, it was also my first encounter with an uncooperative group.
