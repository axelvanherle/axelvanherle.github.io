Welcome to my blog!

As a student of electronics ICT, I am constantly exploring the latest developments in technology and how they can be applied to real-world problems. Along the way, I have developed a keen interest in Linux, automation, DevOps, and web design, and I am excited to share my knowledge and experiences with you through this platform. Whether you are a fellow student, a tech enthusiast, or simply curious about these topics, I invite you to join me on this journey of discovery and learning.

Got something you want to ask? You can contact me on any platform you find below.
