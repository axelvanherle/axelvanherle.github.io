Welcome to my blog!

As a student of electronics ICT, I am constantly exploring the latest developments in technology and how they can be applied to real-world problems. Along the way, I have developed a keen interest in Linux, automation, DevOps, and web design, and I am excited to share my knowledge and experiences with you through this platform. Whether you are a fellow student, a tech enthusiast, or simply curious about these topics, I invite you to join me on this journey of discovery and learning.

Just a quick note: I am not writing this blog to boast or teach anyone anything. I simply enjoy writing and plan to maintain this blog for the sole purpose of looking back on it in the future. However, if someone picks up something new , or even just finds reading it interesting, that's even better.

Got something you want to ask? You can contact me on any platform you find below.
