    <h1>How i got this site up and running.</h1>

    <p>Hello, so this post is just a quick explanation of how I got this website up and running.</p>
<p>First of all, it&rsquo;s hosted via GitHub pages. This makes it so I don&rsquo;t have to go through any effort of setting this up myself, and it&rsquo;s nice practice in case I need to use it some other time. Although an argument could be made that hosting my own site would have been better practice.</p>
<p>Once I could actually host something, I decided that it&rsquo;s time to make this something good. One small issue, I know nothing of web design. So, what&rsquo;s the logical next step? Learning about it.</p>
<p>At one point, I had my own website online, made it using Bootstrap. This, however, isn&rsquo;t a good option because to have something decent it would require me to actually <em>learn</em> these languages. So, I opted to learn something easier, Hugo.</p>
<p>Now, what is that you might ask? This site was built using it. It&rsquo;s a static site generator, all I need to do is configure it and give it some Markdown files (like the one you are reading right now). I got most of what I know from watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFL09qhKi5I">this</a> video, and the rest I learned from all other available documentation online.</p>
<p>TLDR; This is built using Hugo and hosted using GitHub pages.</p>
