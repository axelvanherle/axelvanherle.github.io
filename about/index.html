If you clicked on this page, you probably want to know more about me. So, here goes. I&rsquo;m currently a student and plan on being one for a bit longer. I don&rsquo;t have an interest in working full-time as of now, as I still enjoy studying. I plan on pursuing a master&rsquo;s degree, and perhaps a doctorate if I feel inclined. But who knows? A lot can change.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve been interested in technology for as long as I can remember. From gaming with my dad to tinkering with my grandmother&rsquo;s computer system. Once I enrolled in my current field of study, Electronics ICT, this passion truly ignited. I&rsquo;m particularly drawn to the ICT aspect of things. I&rsquo;m especially interested in Linux and FOSS software. Over time, I&rsquo;ve developed a more conservative view on software, preferring simple, lightweight applications over their complex counterparts.</p><p>This site is one of the projects I took on on as my passion grew. I believe everyone should have a personal site they can call their own. I created this site as a way to share my passion for the things I care about and the projects I undertake.</p><p>If you&rsquo;d like to contact me, details are available on my <a href=/contact/>contact</a> page. And if you&rsquo;re curious about the software I use daily, feel free to check out the <a href=/programs/>programs</a> page.</p><div id=nextprev><a href=/contact/><div id=prevart>Previous:<br>Contact Me</div></a></div></article></main><footer><a href=https://axelvanherle.xyz>https://axelvanherle.xyz</a><br><br><a href=/index.xml><img src=/rss.svg style=max-height:1.5em alt="RSS Feed" title="Subscribe via RSS for updates."></a></footer></body></html>
