This post is going to be about how i used a Raspberry Pi, Python, Grafana, Prometheus, Docker and some sensors that i picked up from AliExpress for a few bucks.</p><h2 id=so-what-the-hell-did-i-make>So what the hell did i make?</h2><p>Well, take a look for yourself;</p><table><thead><tr><th>OpenweatherAPI & System metrics</th><th>Bedroom & Bathroom</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><img src=/img/2024-03-12_rpimonitor/db1.png alt="Dashboard 1"></td><td><img src=/img/2024-03-12_rpimonitor/db2.png alt="Dashboard 2"></td></tr><tr><td><img src=/img/2024-03-12_rpimonitor/db4.png alt="Dashboard 4"></td><td><img src=/img/2024-03-12_rpimonitor/db3.png alt="Dashboard 3"></td></tr></tbody></table><p>What you see is a couple of dashboard that allow me to monitor a bunch of metric in and around my room. A dashboard has been created that allows to me track the temperature and humidity in by bed and bathroom. In addition to tracking those two in my bedroom i also track the light intensity, I could&rsquo;ve done that in the bathroom too but who cares about that if we&rsquo;re being honest here.</p></p><p style=font-size:.8em><a href=/blog/2024-03-12_raspiroommonitor/>Read More</a></p><br></article><article><p><a href=/blog/2023-11-27_dnssinkhole/>Why you should setup a DNS sinkhole</a></p><p style=font-size:.8em><p>I&rsquo;ve know about the concept for years now, but i always imagined it to be a pain to setup. In said imagination it was going to take me days to set this up, and i recently got to it because my exams were over.</p><p>Only thing is; it took me a grand total of 30 minutes to set it up. This blogpost is going to be about how and what i did to set it up, and hopefully inspire you to do the same.</p></p><p style=font-size:.8em><a href=/blog/2023-11-27_dnssinkhole/>Read More</a></p><br></article><article><p><a href=/blog/2023-10-25_kibsite/>My ~25 KiB site is simply better; ranting about the current state of the web, soydevs beware.</a></p><p style=font-size:.8em><p>Let me start this post off by prefacing that i&rsquo;m not counting images here. I&rsquo;m talking about pure HTML/CSS/JS or whatever bullshit frameworks a site might use.</p><p>In today&rsquo;s world most websites are simply bloated, no way around it. But what exactly am I talking about here? These days, most sites are 5-10-20MiB. But why is this? It would be simple to blame it onto soydevs, but often multiple megabyte&rsquo;s of difference are ads, trackers and junk being loaded in.</p></p><p style=font-size:.8em><a href=/blog/2023-10-25_kibsite/>Read More</a></p><br></article><article><p><a href=/blog/2023-09-13_dotfiles/>How i organized my dotfiles</a></p><p style=font-size:.8em><h1 id=how-i-organized-my-dotfiles-using-git>How i organized my dotfiles using git.</h1><p>It seems appropriate to start this post off with giving an explanation as to <em>why</em> i would want to do this.</p><p>Luckily this is simple to explain; I&rsquo;m a lazy fucker, that&rsquo;s why. No really, that&rsquo;s pretty much all there is too it. I simply wanted to make the process of syncing my dotfiles to and from multiple of my systems (most notably my laptop and my desktop) easier.</p></p><p style=font-size:.8em><a href=/blog/2023-09-13_dotfiles/>Read More</a></p><br></article><br><hr><br></h1></header><article></article></main><footer><a href=https://axelvanherle.xyz/>https://axelvanherle.xyz/</a><br><br><a href=/index.xml><img src=/rss.svg style=max-height:1.5em alt="RSS Feed" title="Subscribe via RSS for updates."></a></footer></body></html>
