    <h1>Welcome to my site!</h1>

    <h3>Current interests ðŸ¤”</h3>
    <p>
      I am currently interested in a variety of topics related to automation and
      software development. Specifically, I have been focusing on learning more
      about GitHub actions, I have been using them to automate a variety of
      tasks, such as building and deploying code, deploying docker containers
      and more. In addition to my interest in automation, I have also been
      focusing on improving my skills with Git.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm also improving my skills navigating around a Linux CLI and vim.
    </p>
    <h3>Other</h3>
    <p>
      I know there's not much to find here at the moment, there might not be for
      a while.
    </p>
    <p>
      So until I change anything, this cat will be dancing for all eternity.
